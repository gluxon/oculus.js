enforce.js
==========

WARNING
-------
This new version does not compile. It uses a custom modified version of node-opencv. Please wait until this modification is pushed to the official npm package.

What is this?
-------------
enforce.js is a server to process calculations for images taken on the field. It is
designed to run on a linux system co-processor, and communicates through a TCP
socket on port 178.

What is Image Analysis
----------------------
The Image Analysis portion of the 2013 game, Ultimate Ascent is software designed to
calculate the distance and location of shooting targets on the field, given a camera
image of retro reflective material bounding the targets.

For more, see the [Vision Targets White Paper](https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-20173)
for a general idea.

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------
wolf.js requires at least Node.js 0.8. Please refer to [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)
for the Node.js installation. After standard git checkout/clone, run the following command to
automatically download and install all required dependencies.

```

Then start enforce.js with Node.js
